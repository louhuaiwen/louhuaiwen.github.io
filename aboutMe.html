        My name is Huaiwen Lou, a 20 years old Computaional Media major student from Georgia Tech. 
        My interets are drawing, video editing and photography.
        
        I like to draw since I was a kid. I painted on sketch papers with crayons and pens since I was in 
        kindergarten and started to draw cartoon characters in elementary. The first time I draw on my computer 
        was in middle school. I was using the mouse and trying to do sketch on photoshop.
        Later on, I got a tablet in highschool so I can actually draw on the screen using a electic pen. 
        I never stopped drawing and creating my art. 
        </p>
